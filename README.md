# WhatWhereWhenTelegram
Telegram bot to improve your skills in the game “What? Where? When?”

What does the project do?
The program uses your bot to send questions (and of course answers).
An open question bank is used to play the game (the packet is randomly generated).

Why is the project useful?
Allows you to play this great game from anywhere (as well as thousands of other bots on this game). However, if you want to change the rules (change the time before an answer, make a blitz/superblitz or, for example, add ML or AI to calculate the proximity of a given answer to the correct one) then this bot will help you do that. 
You can use all of this to add functionality to an existing bot. 

How can users get started with the project?
Copy the project in any convenient way. In main enter the bot token as the second parameter. After launching, in your bot, write the command \start. 

Where can users get help on the project?
This project is quite simple and I think even when I add more functionality to it, it will remain simple. However, if you need help, you can write me on telegram.
